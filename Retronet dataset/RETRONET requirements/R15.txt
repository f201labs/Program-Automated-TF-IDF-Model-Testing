Since the majority of projects are not completed in a single setting, then it is critical to provide the user the option to load an existing project to continue working on the project.  Load Project feature will provide the user the capacity to open an existing project in the last saved state with all the associated mode options. [1] The user shall be able to cancel the LOAD PROJECT action and return to the previous activity.
