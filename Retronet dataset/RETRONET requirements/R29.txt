Similar in functionality to the START NEW PROJECT function, the LOAD RTM function collects project parameters from the user and initializes the project.  A project created via the LOAD RTM function may be in either “trace” or “assess” mode.  Assess mode is usually used when the user is provided a RTM and needs to evaluate its accuracy, completeness, and satisfaction level. The user shall be able to cancel the process and return to the previous state at any time before the project is created.
