Similar in functionality to the START NEW PROJECT function, the LOAD RTM function collects project parameters from the user and initializes the project.  A project created via the LOAD RTM function may be in either “trace” or “assess” mode.  Assess mode is usually used when the user is provided a RTM and needs to evaluate its accuracy, completeness, and satisfaction level. The user shall optionally be prompted to provide a “Feedback Method”.  “Standard Rochio” is currently the only option.
