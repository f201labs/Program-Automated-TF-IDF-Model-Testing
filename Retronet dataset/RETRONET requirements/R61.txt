The user needs a mechanism that will help to determine whether the TRACING was successfully performed based on accuracy and completeness.  An accuracy test tells the user that the candidate links provided are correctly related to the high-level requirement.  Completeness test tells the user that all possible links that are listed in the candidate list are included and no low-level requirements are missing. [1] RETRO shall provide a mechanism for the user to be able to run an ACCURACY & COMPLETENESS check by performing a full trace on the requirements and comparing the IR method results to the given RTM.
